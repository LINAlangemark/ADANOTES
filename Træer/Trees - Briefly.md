**Linked lists have linear "acces-time", and so not feasible for large amounts of data -- The solution is trees!**

*Necessary Operations:*  Insert() and delete()

**Binary Search Tree (BST):**
**Definition:** *balance condition* -- the depth of the tree is O(log N) 
	--> thus the searchtime is likewise O(log N))
	The balance condition can be "ruined" if the tree becomes left- or right-heavy due to consecutive deletions or insertions

**Internal Path Length:** The sum of depths of all the nodes
